What went wrong with likelihood 1.0 in the state [dirt1: 0, dirt2: 1, energy: 6, room_blocked: 0, slippery_level: 2] with action NEXT ending up in [dirt1: -2, dirt2: 1, energy: 6, room_blocked: 0, slippery_level: 2]? Explain it to me.
Return me additionally in JSON format an valid alternative action and the type of error {"action": "ACTION_NAME", "error":"ERROR_TYPE"}.Be aware of the energy consumptions and all sources of potential mistakes. The error categories are as follows: out_of_energy, collision, charging_error, other. Note that a negative dirt1 value indicates only indicates that the environment has terminated (nothing else).
In the given scenario, the action `NEXT` was chosen while the robot was in the state `[dirt1: 0, dirt2: 1, energy: 6, room_blocked: 0, slippery_level: 2]`. According to the PRISM model, the `NEXT` action has a transition that sets `dirt1' = -2` when `energy = 0` or `(dirt1 > 0 & room_blocked = false)` or `(dirt2 > 0 & room_blocked = false) & NO_GAME_OVER`. However, the condition `dirt1 > 0` is not met in this case, as `dirt1 = 0`. The transition should not have been triggered as described, leading to an incorrect state update where `dirt1` becomes `-2`.

This appears to be an error in the model's logic or in the implementation of the action, as the conditions specified do not align with the state variables provided. The error type here can be categorized as "other" since it does not fit into the specified categories of energy, collision, or charging issues.

A valid alternative action in this scenario, considering the state variables, could be to use the `CLEAN21` action to clean `dirt2` since `dirt2 > 0`, `energy > 0`, and `room_blocked = false`. This action would reduce `dirt2` by 1 and decrease energy by 1, which is a valid and energy-conserving move.

Here is the JSON format for the valid alternative action and the type of error:

```json
{
  "action": "CLEAN21",
  "error": "other"
}
```
