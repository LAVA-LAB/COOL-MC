What went wrong with likelihood 1.0 in the state [dirt1: 0, dirt2: 1, energy: 6, room_blocked: 0, slippery_level: 2] with action NEXT ending up in [dirt1: -2, dirt2: 1, energy: 6, room_blocked: 0, slippery_level: 2]? Explain it to me.
Return me additionally in JSON format an valid alternative action and the type of error {"action": "ACTION_NAME", "error":"ERROR_TYPE"}.Be aware of the energy consumptions and all sources of potential mistakes. The error categories are as follows: out_of_energy, collision, charging_error, other. Note that a negative dirt1 value indicates only indicates that the environment has terminated (nothing else).
In the given scenario, the state is described as follows:
- dirt1: 0
- dirt2: 1
- energy: 6
- room_blocked: 0
- slippery_level: 2

The action taken was NEXT, which is intended for changing rooms if the room is clean or blocked. However, in this case, the room was not clean because there was still dirt2 present (dirt2: 1). Therefore, the action NEXT was incorrect because it was used while there was still dirt that needed to be cleaned. This led to the termination of the environment, indicated by the negative value of dirt1 in the resulting state.

The correct action should have been to clean the remaining dirt2. Since the slippery level was 2, using a strong cleaning action would be appropriate to avoid increasing the slippery level further. Given the energy level was sufficient (6 units), using CLEAN22 (strong cleaning for dirt2 with an energy consumption of 3) would have been a valid choice.

Here is the JSON format for a valid alternative action and the type of error:

```json
{
  "action": "CLEAN22",
  "error": "other"
}
```

The error type is categorized as "other" because the primary mistake was using an inappropriate action (NEXT) when cleaning was still required.
