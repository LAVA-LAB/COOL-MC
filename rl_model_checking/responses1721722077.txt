What went wrong with likelihood 0.9 in the state [dirt1: 0, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1] with action CHARGE2 ending up in [dirt1: -5, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1]? Explain it to me.
Return me additionally in JSON format an valid alternative action and the type of error {"action": "ACTION_NAME", "error":"ERROR_TYPE"}.Be aware of the energy consumptions and all sources of potential mistakes. The error categories are as follows: out_of_energy, collision, charging_error, other. Note that a negative dirt1 value indicates only indicates that the environment has terminated (nothing else).
In the given scenario, the state before the action was [dirt1: 0, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1], and the action taken was CHARGE2. The resulting state was [dirt1: -5, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1]. The negative value of dirt1 in the resulting state indicates that the environment has terminated, but it does not provide specific information about the nature of the error itself.

Analyzing the action CHARGE2:
- CHARGE2 is a weak charging action that can be performed regardless of whether the room is blocked or not, and it is intended for situations where the energy level is less than or equal to 2.
- In this case, the robot's energy level was 3, which is above the threshold for CHARGE2. Therefore, attempting to charge when the energy level is already above the threshold for this action likely caused a charging error.

The error in this scenario is a "charging_error" because the robot attempted to charge when its energy level did not necessitate it, specifically using CHARGE2 when the energy was greater than 2.

A valid alternative action in this scenario, considering the state of the room (blocked, dirt2 present, and slippery), would be to use the action NEXT to move to a different room since the current room is blocked and the robot cannot clean or effectively charge in this state.

Here is the JSON format for the valid alternative action and the type of error:

```json
{
  "action": "NEXT",
  "error": "charging_error"
}
```
