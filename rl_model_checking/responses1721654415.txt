What went wrong with likelihood 0.9 in the state [dirt1: 0, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1] with action CHARGE2 ending up in [dirt1: -5, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1]? Explain it to me.
Return me additionally in JSON format an valid alternative action and the type of error {"action": "ACTION_NAME", "error":"ERROR_TYPE"}.Be aware of the energy consumptions and all sources of potential mistakes. The error categories are as follows: out_of_energy, collision, charging_error, other. Note that a negative dirt1 value indicates only indicates that the environment has terminated (nothing else).
In the scenario described, the robot attempted to execute the `CHARGE2` action while having an energy level of 3, which is greater than 2. According to the PRISM model, the `CHARGE2` action has different outcomes based on the current energy level:

1. If `energy > 2`, the model specifies a 90% chance of setting `dirt1` to -5, which is a termination state (indicated by `dirt1` becoming negative), and a 10% chance of increasing the energy by up to 3 units, capped by `MAX_ENERGY`.

The error here is that the robot, despite having sufficient energy to avoid termination, ends up in a termination state (`dirt1 = -5`) with a high likelihood (90%). This is due to the model's design where the action `CHARGE2` is risky when the energy level is above 2, as it primarily leads to a game-over state rather than effectively charging the robot. This can be categorized as a `charging_error` because the action's intended effect (to charge the robot) is overshadowed by a high risk of termination.

Here is a JSON representation of a valid alternative action that avoids this error, considering the robot's current state:

```json
{
  "action": "CHARGE1",
  "error": "charging_error"
}
```

The `CHARGE1` action is more appropriate in this context because it offers a safer charging mechanism when the energy is low (â‰¤ 2), providing a 50% chance to increase the energy significantly without risking immediate termination. Even though the robot's energy is slightly above 2, adjusting the model or choosing a less risky action when the energy is close to this threshold could be a strategic decision to avoid unnecessary terminations.
