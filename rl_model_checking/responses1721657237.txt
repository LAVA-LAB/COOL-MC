What went wrong with likelihood 1.0 in the state [dirt1: 0, dirt2: 1, energy: 6, room_blocked: 0, slippery_level: 2] with action NEXT ending up in [dirt1: -2, dirt2: 1, energy: 6, room_blocked: 0, slippery_level: 2]? Explain it to me.
Return me additionally in JSON format an valid alternative action and the type of error {"action": "ACTION_NAME", "error":"ERROR_TYPE"}.Be aware of the energy consumptions and all sources of potential mistakes. The error categories are as follows: out_of_energy, collision, charging_error, other. Note that a negative dirt1 value indicates only indicates that the environment has terminated (nothing else).
In the given scenario, the state before the action was [dirt1: 0, dirt2: 1, energy: 6, room_blocked: 0, slippery_level: 2] and the action taken was NEXT. The action NEXT is intended to change rooms if the current room is either clean or blocked. However, in this case, the room was not clean because it still had dirt2 present. Therefore, the action NEXT was incorrect because it was used while the room still required cleaning. This led to the termination of the environment, indicated by the negative value of dirt1 in the resulting state.

The correct action should have been to address the cleaning needs of the room, specifically targeting the dirt2 while considering the slippery level. Since the slippery level was 2, the agent should ideally wait until the slippery level is reduced to zero before attempting to clean to avoid any potential hazards or inefficiencies.

Here is a valid alternative action in JSON format, considering the state of the room and the rules of the environment:

```json
{
  "action": "IDLE",
  "error": "other"
}
```

The action IDLE is chosen because the slippery level is 2, and it's safer for the agent to wait until the slippery level is zero before attempting any cleaning action. The error type is categorized as "other" because the primary mistake was using an inappropriate action (NEXT) when the room still required cleaning and had a non-zero slippery level.
