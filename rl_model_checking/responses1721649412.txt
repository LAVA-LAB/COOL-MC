What went wrong with likelihood 0.9 in the state [dirt1: 0, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1] with action CHARGE2 ending up in [dirt1: -5, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1]? Explain it to me.
Return me additionally in JSON format an valid alternative action and the type of error {"action": "ACTION_NAME", "error":"ERROR_TYPE"}.Be aware of the energy consumptions and all sources of potential mistakes. The error categories are as follows: out_of_energy, collision, charging_error, other. Note that a negative dirt1 value indicates only indicates that the environment has terminated (nothing else).
In the given scenario, the state is [dirt1: 0, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1], and the action taken is CHARGE2. The resulting state is [dirt1: -5, dirt2: 3, energy: 3, room_blocked: 1, slippery_level: 1]. The negative value of dirt1 (-5) indicates that the environment has terminated, but it does not provide specific information about the nature of the error itself.

Analyzing the initial state and the action:
- **dirt1**: 0 (no dirt of type 1)
- **dirt2**: 3 (presence of dirt type 2)
- **energy**: 3 (sufficient energy)
- **room_blocked**: 1 (the room is blocked)
- **slippery_level**: 1 (the room is slippery)

The action CHARGE2 is intended for weak charging and can be performed regardless of whether the room is blocked. The energy level is 3, which is above the threshold for charging actions (which require energy to be less than or equal to 2). Therefore, performing a charging action when the energy level is already above this threshold leads to a charging error.

The error in this scenario is a "charging_error" because the action CHARGE2 was taken when the energy level did not meet the criteria for charging (energy should be â‰¤ 2).

A valid alternative action in this scenario, considering the room is blocked and there is a slippery level, would be to wait (IDLE) until the slippery level is reduced to zero. This action avoids any collisions, charging errors, or unnecessary energy consumption.

Here is the JSON format for a valid alternative action and the type of error:

```json
{
  "action": "IDLE",
  "error": "charging_error"
}
```
